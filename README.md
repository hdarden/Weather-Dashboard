# Weather-Dashboard

The object of this weather assignment is to create a search bar to search the weather in various cities. When the city is searched, the current weather is displayed and there is a 5 day weather forecast displayed. 


The date temperature, humidity, and windspeed is displayed for the current weather.

For the five day weather forecast the date, temp, and humidity is displayed.

*** I had a hard time getting the icons and UV index to show up in my browser which is why it is commented out in my code.
